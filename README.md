# SMB1 Remake
Super mario 1 partial remake in unity.

## To run:
The latest builds are automatically available on [Unity Butt Deployment](https://developer.butt.unity3d.com/build/orgs/serg06/projects/roguelike/).

## To develop:
Open folder in Unity, select MAIN scene.

## To do:
In hindsight, I'd like to change one thing: Currently, I manually find the Mario map online, add hidden pixels in Photoshop for map generation, and then have the code generate the map (place blocks, mobs, etc.) Instead, I'd like to skip the Photoshop step: Just scan the image to figure out how to generate the map.
